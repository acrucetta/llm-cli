Codebase Indexing Features

- Cache each file and add them to some form of JSON
- When asking the questions, find the most relevant files
- Add them to the file context, then load the prompt
- If we've indexed a similar codebase, check the cache for it
then avoid having to re-index it


Chat History Features

- Load chat old conversations and bring them to context
- e.g., llm chat ls
- e.g., llm chat open #id
- e.g., llm chat preview #id
